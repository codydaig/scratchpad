# Cody's Scratchpad

This git repo is a collection of the notes that I take as I learn new technologies, programming languages, server applications, etc.... Hopefully this will limit the amount of time I google the same "how-to" twice. 

** NOTE: Some of the notes in this repo may be specific to my server and/or computer configurations and values may need to be changed accordingly. 

Hope this helps someone out there!
